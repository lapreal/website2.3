					<h2>
						Project Overview 
					</h2>
					<p>
						While at the BYU Office of IT, I was challenged with the task to automate a previously manual process. The President’s Office at BYU offers three acknowledgment benefits to their full-time employees: providing a baby blanket for a newborn or adopted child, a floral arrangement for deceased full-time and retired employees, and a book memorial for deceased parents or minor children of the employee. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Prior to this project, the University Relations department was required to manually search through obituaries and take calls 24/7 attempting to discover BYU employees who have passed on. Due to the archaic process of finding the deceased employees, many would fall through the cracks leaving already devastated families hurting even more.
					</p>
					<p> <strong>Timeline:&nbsp;</strong> March 2020-September 2020</p>
					<p> <strong>Hypothesis:&nbsp;</strong> Automating a previously manual process will decrease the overall amount of calls and hours spent on the task. It would also ensure that fewer employees were forgotten and less feelings hurt at an already devastating time.</p>
					<p> <strong>Team:&nbsp;</strong> I worked closely with the product manger, developer, and stakeholders representing President’s Office and University Relations.</p>
					<p> <strong>Role:&nbsp;</strong> User research, UX design, UI design</p>
					<h2>
						Research
					</h2>
					<p>
						Our stakeholders had gathered together and initially came into this project with a decent amount of research and data for us to delve into. Which turned out to be a blessing and curse (more on this later). 
					</p>
					<p>
						They provided us with enough information to create initial user and admin process flow charts with review. After several revisions and further research with additional stakeholders involved in and effected by the project, we were able to create finalized versions of the flow. These charts were a great reference to not only myself but the developer working on the web application. 
					</p>
					<h2>
						Deliverables
					</h2>
					<p>
						The output of this project was my UI design and the development of the web application which I assisted with until it was completed. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The main challenges I faced while creating this design was keeping the process short and succinct, while getting all the information the President’s Office needed to properly complete the task. It was important to create a process that would empathize with how the user was feeling while meeting the demands of the project sponsors.

					<h2>
						Outcome
					</h2>
					<p>
						Our developer successfully created the website and it went live September 2020, right around the time I left my job to focus on my schooling. 
					</p>
					<p>
						About four months after it’s launched, I reached out to the stakeholders from University Relations to ask how the web app has been performing and to see if KPIs were met. One replied: 
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						“The automation of the President's Remembrance Program was such an excellent move. It has significantly impacted the amount of work that has needed to be done by our office and has streamlined an otherwise bulky set of procedures. Calls have significantly decreased.”
					</blockquote>
					<p>
						I was glad to hear part of my project hypothesis came to light. So far, there is not enough data to prove it has ensured fewer employees are not forgotten.
					</p>
					<h2>
						What I learned
					</h2>
					<p>
						As I was finishing up this project, I realized a few mistakes I had made a long the way. I reached out to a few other stakeholders I previously overlooked during the research, design, and development stages of this project. My original intent was to invite them to test the almost finished prototype. It was then I realized that I should have reached out to these smaller stakeholders way earlier in the process. 	
					</p>
					<p>
						Had I done this, I could have made this product so much better than it turned out to be. Because of the preparedness of the core stakeholder from the President’s Office, I assumed they had already gathered that data. I did not take it into my own hands to be sure all users and admins needs were researched and considered in the design process.
