					<h2>
						Project Overview 
					</h2>
					<p>
						For my senior thesis project, I created Penny. Penny is a mobile app designed to help women in college unleash their financial potential by increasing money confidence to make the financial industry less intimidating. It’s easy to be overwhelmed by all the financial terms and strategies, especially when it comes to investing. Penny makes it easier for women to learn financial literacy and gain money confidence in a delightfully accessible way.
					</p>
					<p> <strong>Timeline:&nbsp;</strong> September 2020-April 2021</p>
					<p> <strong>Hypothesis:&nbsp;</strong> Creating a community where women can learn about finances in a non-threatening way will increase their financial potential. This will also improve overall financial health in most households since women typically make most of the day-to-day financial decisions.</p>
					<p> <strong>Team:&nbsp;</strong> Solo project</p>
					<p> <strong>Role:&nbsp;</strong> User research, UX design, UI design</p>
					<h2>
						Research
					</h2>
					<p>
						I conducted several surveys to validate the problem I thought existed and wanted to solve. I also conducted a few remote usability tests on my earlier, low fidelity prototypes. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The earlier version of the prototype was called “finatic” and taught a real estate investment principle called house hacking. After testing this prototype with my users, I found that women felt their knowledge about real estate investing increased after using the app. Women rated their enjoyment level at a 5.9 our of 10 and 70% of them said they would use the app again to learn about other financial principles. 
					</p>
					<h2>
						Deliverables
					</h2>
					<p>
						Completing my senior project involved three parts: presenting my project to the public at our senior show, creating a webpage and instagram slides to present my project to the public digitally, and designing the final high fidelity prototype design to my professor using Adobe XD.  
					</p>
					<p>
						You can experience Penny for yourself by scanning the QR code below. 
					</p>
					<h2>
						Outcome
					</h2>
					<p>
						While my attempts to work with student developers to actually bring my app design to life was unsuccessful, I did have a chance to validate the concept publicly at our physical and digital senior show.
					</p>
					<p>
						Many of the women I spoke with disappointed they couldn’t actually download the app (yet)! There was clearly a need and my concept fills it. One of the women I spoke with said:
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						“My husband handled all the money our entire marriage, but then when we got divorced, I was on my own handling my own finances and had no idea what to do, especially when it came to investing for retirement. I was able to hack it until getting it figured out. If I had something like this where I can easily learn about money… I would have been much better off. I wish I had this resource!”
					</blockquote>
					<p>
						I was stoked to talk with these women firsthand and hear how excited and how much they needed this app in their lives.
					</p>
					<h2>
						What I learned
					</h2>
					<p>
						I’m a firm believer in learning from my mistakes. In fact, I don’t usually calls mistakes mistakes… I call them learning opportunities.  	
					</p>
					<p>
						One of my learning opportunities from this project was centered around time management (honestly speaking, priorities). I should have conducted formal usability testing on the final prototype, however I didn’t because I was juggling my new full-time position (at NICE CXone) while finishing up my schooling. Because my full-time job was paying me a nice salary and completing my senior project wasn’t, I prioritized my job over my schooling. I didn’t necessarily regret this decision, however I acknowledge I could have handle my time a little better!
